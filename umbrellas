          <p>Life is too short to walk around with a broken, lame or just plain ugly umbrella. Artisanal Umbrellas came together to link Umbrella challenged Portlandians with locally sourced, hand crafted, environmentally friendly umbrellas. For free! We take donations from Umbrella Artisans make high quality, beautiful designed umbrellas and share them with those unfortunates walking around with less than stellar umbrellas.</p>
